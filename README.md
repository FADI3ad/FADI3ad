# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Fady Emad, a Computer Science student and Backend Developer passionate about building efficient and scalable web applications.  
With a focus on **Laravel (PHP)**, I design and develop robust backend systems, implement APIs, and structure clean architectures that help projects grow smoothly.  

As a problem solver, I sharpen my skills daily by solving algorithmic challenges with **C++**, combining both academic knowledge and competitive programming practice.  

I enjoy collaborating with teams on both tactical and strategic levels â€” from designing system architectures and database structures, to writing clean code and setting up proper workflows.  

Some of the areas Iâ€™m diving deeper into include **SQL**.
